# Game of Life +

This is a thing we made to test out some high-performance front end computing techniques using just vanilla JavaScript!

There were some WebWorkers here, but since Meltdown killed `SharedArrayBuffer`, everything broke... Maybe they'll be back some day so you can get the _most_ threads running Game of Life (as we all know, is what we are all dreaming of). Until then, we'll just have our best implementation so far using just the HTML5 Canvas API.

### Other things we wanted to bring in and still might:
* WebGL
* WASM
* GPGPU
* Infinite Scroll
* Versus Mode
